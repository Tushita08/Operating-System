Server file: server_2015097r1.java
Client file: client_2015097r1.java

* First run server_2015097r1.java to run server and then the clients using client_2015097r1.java in different terminals to connect to the same server. 
* Server can handle multiple clients.
* Clients are need to be open in different terminals.
* Normal counter is used to give each client an ID.

Following are the capabilities of full-fledged chat application like Whatsapp. 

A client, say client 0, should be able to send following types of messages:

a) Client X: Message - the message will be delivered to Client X.
b) All: Message - the message will be delivered to all present clients.
c) Client X,Y: Message - the message will be delivered to Client X and Y only
d) Server: "List All" - the message will go to server which will then reply with the list of all the clients that are currently connected.
e) If a client sends a message to another client which does not exist then the server should reply back saying the client does not exist.
